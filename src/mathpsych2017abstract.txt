A Hierarchical Diffusion Model Analysis of the Approximate Number System

Mark Andrews & Chloe Wider

The Approximate Number System (ANS) is the cognitive system that underlies our
ability to nonverbally estimate and represent numerical quantities. A typical
task used to measure an individual's ANS acuity involves the presentation of
two random displays of dots and then the individual choosing whichever display
has the larger number of dots. ANS acuity is then quantified in terms of a
Weber fraction that gives the minimum difference in the numbers of dots in the
two displays that is noticeable by that individual. The Weber fraction is
calculated solely on the basis of the individual's accuracy. However, the ANS
task is a paradigm example of a two alternative forced choice task, and it is
well establised that in these tasks speed of response may be traded off for
increased accuracy and vice versa. It is arguable therefore than an improved
measure of ANS acuity can be obtained by modelling individuals' performance
using sequential sampling model, which have been well established as accurate
models of speeded decision making. In this study, we analyse performance on the
ANS task using a Hierarchical (multilevel) drift diffusion model.
